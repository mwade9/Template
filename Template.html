      <p>Hi everyone, I am Michael and I am currently majoring in cyber security with a minor in CIS. I am a sophomore, and I live in the dorms on campus. My mom works at UIW at the
        finnancial aid. I am super thankful for her because her job reduces the price to go here a ton. I plan to keep my major because I think the internet as well as technology is so 
      fascinating. </p>
